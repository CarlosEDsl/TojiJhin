# Personal Training Management System

## Overview

The **Personal Training Management System** is a web application designed to facilitate the management of personal training sessions. It enables trainers to efficiently manage their clients, create and assign workout plans, and oversee progress. This system utilizes:

- **Express** and **Node.js** for the backend
- **TSOA** for API design and documentation
- **Swagger** for interactive API documentation

## Key Features

### Trainer Management

- **Account Creation:** Trainers can create their accounts and set up profiles, including credentials and personal information.
- **Client Management:** Trainers can view, update, and delete client profiles, managing client information, progress, and workout history.

### Client Management

- **Account Creation:** Trainers can create and manage client accounts, setting up individual profiles with personal details, goals, and preferences.
- **Progress Tracking:** Trainers can track and review client progress, including workout completion and performance metrics.

### Workout Plans

- **Creation and Assignment:** Trainers can create detailed workout plans and assign them to clients. Plans include exercises, sets, reps, and other details.
- **Customization:** Trainers can tailor workout plans based on individual client needs and goals.

### Interactive API Documentation

- **Swagger Integration:** Interactive API documentation is provided via Swagger, allowing developers and trainers to explore and test API endpoints efficiently.
- **TSOA for API Design:** TSOA is used to define and enforce API routes, ensuring a well-structured and consistent API.

## Technology Stack

- **Backend Framework:** Express.js
- **Runtime Environment:** Node.js
- **API Design and Documentation:** TSOA
- **Interactive API Documentation:** Swagger

## How It Works

1. **Initialization:**
   - User authentication and authorization are implemented through Express middleware.

2. **API Design:**
   - TSOA defines routes, controllers, and models, ensuring a well-structured API.

3. **Interactive Documentation:**
   - Swagger provides an interactive interface for exploring and testing API endpoints.

4. **Client and Trainer Interaction:**
   - Trainers manage clients, assign workout plans, and track progress via the application's UI.
   - Clients receive workout plans, log progress, and view performance metrics.

## Benefits

- **Efficient Management:** Streamline client and workout plan management, saving time and improving engagement.
- **Enhanced Tracking:** Monitor client performance and adjust workout plans as needed.
- **Interactive API:** Simplify API exploration and testing with Swaggerâ€™s interactive documentation.

This system aims to streamline personal training management, providing trainers with the tools they need to effectively manage clients and optimize training programs.
